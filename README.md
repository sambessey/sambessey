# 👋 Hi, I'm @sambessey                                                                                     
                                                                                                              
  Solutions Engineer based in Melbourne. I build things and explain how they work.

  ## What I do

  - 🛠️ I build demo apps, tooling, and integrations — mostly in **TypeScript** and **Next.js**, with
  **Redis**, **Firebase** (realtime data + Firestore), and **WebSockets**
  - 🧩 I make **Chrome extensions** to help SEs (like me) run better demos
  - 📡 I recently built a real-time **clientelling dashboard** powered by Amperity CDP with live customer
  data, segment tracking, and 5-second auto-refresh
  - 🐍 I know enough Python to be (slightly) dangerous

  ## What I'm working on

  - ✍️ Writing a series called **[AI & Reality: Modern AI in Plain
  English](https://sambessey.com/articles)** — pragmatic explainers on RAG, MCP, vector databases,
  and agents with full code examples
  - 🔧 Building **Doppio** — a real-time content layer for Google Slides
  - 📖 Maintaining a plain-English **[AI glossary](https://sambessey.com/glossary)** for the
  concepts I find myself explaining most often

  ## How I think about technical writing

  I spend a lot of my time explaining technical features to non-technical people. My articles are my working
  notes on how I explain these concepts to others: More practical diagrams and code, less buzzwords.
