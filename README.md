- 👋 Hi, I’m @sambessey
- 👀 I'm proficient in TypeScript, Redis, Firebase (As a datastore and live data retrieval), and using Websockets
- 🧩 I like dabbling with Chrome extensions to help SE's (like me!) do better demos
- 🐍 I know enough Python to be (slightly) dangerous
- 🌱 I’m currently building a series of articles and tutorials on RAG, MCP, and agents with full code examples, publishing weekly
